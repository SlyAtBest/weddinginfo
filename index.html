				<h1>General Information</h1>
				<p>WE HAVE CHOSEN TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION USING A WEBSITE BECAUSE IT
				ALLOWS US THE FLEXIBILITY TO UPDATE THE INFORMATION AS WE NEED TO.  WITH THIS IN MIND
				PLEASE CONTINUE TO CHECK BACK FROM TIME TO TIME, ESPECIALLY AS WE DRAW CLOSER TO THE 
			    BIG DAY.</p>
				<h2>Venue Location & Accommodation</h2>
				<p>BOTH OUR WEDDING AND RECEPTION IS TAKING PLACE AT THE IDYLLIC COMBE MANOR BARNS, 
				A WONDERFUL VENUE SET IN THE BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF COMBE. WITH NO CHANGE OF VENUE, ONCE
				YOU ARRIVE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE IN FOR THE DAY.  ROUGHLY LOCATED INBETWEEN, ANDOVER, 
				NEWBURY AND HUNGERFORD, IT GIVES PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR ACCOMMODATION, BUT SADLY THERE IS LITTLE 
				WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE.  AS SUCH IT'S LIKELY YOU WILL NEED A DESIGNATED DRIVER OR THE USE OF
			    TAXIS TO GET AROUND SO PLEASE BEAR THIS IN MIND.  FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT
			    THE LOCATION PAGE VIA THE NAVIGATION BAR.  FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE WE WILL ALSO BE ADDING A LIST 
			    OF HOTELS AND TAXI COMPANIES TO THE NAVIGATION BAR ABOVE, SO PLEASE CHECK BACK LATER.</p>
				<h2>Little Ones & Youngsters</h2>
				<p> SADLY DUE TO A RESTRICTION ON NUMBERS WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ANY LITTLE
				ONES OR YOUNGSTERS AS PART OF OUR WEDDING OR RECEPTION. EXCEPT THOSE INVOLVED IN THE WEDDING
			    PARTY.  WE APPRECIATE THIS MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE OR VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF YOU
			    TO ATTEND, BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN LOOK AFTER YOUR LOVED ONES FOR
			    A DAY OR TWO WE WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU COULD BE THERE.</p>
				<h2>Parking & Disabled Access</h2>
				<p>THERE IS A DEDICATED CAR PARK AT THE VENUE, SO FINDING A SPACE SHOULD NOT BE AN
				ISSUE.  GUESTS ARE ALSO ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR VEHICLES ONSITE OVERNIGHT SHOULD THEY
				WISH.  ANY VEHICLES LEFT WILL NEED TO BE COLLECTED THE NEXT DAY.  THE CAR PARK IS 
				SITUATED NOT FAR FROM THE BARN, BUT FOR THOSE REQUIRING DISABLED ACCESS, IT IS 
				POSSIBLE TO DROP OFF EVEN CLOSER IF NEEDED.  THE VENUE ITSELF IS ACROSS A SINGLE 
			    LEVEL AND A DISABLED TOILET IS AVAILABLE</p>
				<h2>Phone Signal</h2>
				<p>DUE TO THE RURAL LOCATION OF OUR WEDDING VENUE, THE PHONE RECEPTION IN THE LOCAL
				AREA IS AWFUL.  THE ONLY NETWORK WE'RE AWARE OF THAT HAS ANY
			    RECEPTION IS EE.  WITH THIS IN MIND, PLEASE BE SURE TO BOOK ANY TAXIS IN ADVANCE AND
			    IF YOU NEED TO LEAVE AN EMERGENCY CONTACT WITH ANYONE (SUCH AS A BABYSITTER), PLEASE TRY
			    AND ENSURE IT'S A NUMBER ON THE EE NETWORK WHERE POSSIBLE. WE'LL BE SETTING UP A PAY AS YOU GO
				PHONE FOR THE EVENT SO GUESTS WILL BE WELCOME TO USE THIS AS A POINT OF CONTACT AND MAKING
				OUTGOING CALLS OR TEXTS IF NEEDED.</p>
			    <h2>Food & Drink</h2>
			    <p>FOR THE WEDDING BREAKFAST WE WILL BE PROVIDING A SET MENU SUPPLIED BY OUR AWARD WINNING CATERERS.
			    WE SAMPLED THE MENU AND WERE BLOWN AWAY SO WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO.  IT 
			    IS HOWEVER VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU ADD ANY DIETARY REQUIREMENTS TO THE LITTLE CARD INCLUDED WITH THE 
			    INVITES AND PLEASE RETURN THESE ALONG WITH YOUR RSVP SO WE CAN FEED THIS BACK TO THE CATERERS. FOR THE 
			    EVENING RECEPTION WE WILL BE PROVIDING A HOG ROAST, ALONG WITH A VEGETARIAN ALTERNATIVE AS REQUIRED. THERE WILL
			    ALSO BE A CASH BAR FOR THE EVENING RECEPTION, SO PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADEQUATE CASH ON YOU. WE
			    HAVEN'T CONFIRMED WHAT TIME THIS WILL START SERVING, WE'LL UPDATE THIS SECTION WHEN WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION.</p>
				<h2>Wedding Gifts</h2>
				<p class='poem'>WE KNOW IT'S NOT TRADITION,<br>ITS'NOT THE WAY IT'S DONE,<br>
				BUT INSTEAD OF A WEDDING LIST,<br>WE'D LIKE A BIT OF SUN.<br><br>
			    WE'VE LIVED TOGETHER QUITE A WHILE,<br>AND ALL THE BILLS ARE PAID,<br>
			    WE'VE GOT OUR PLATES, OUR POTS AND PANS,<br>OUR PLANS HAVE ALL BEEN MADE.<br><br>
			    WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP THOUGH,<br>TO SEND US ON OUR WAY,<br>
			    A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR HONEYMOON,<br>IN A LAND QUITE FAR AWAY.<br><br>
			    BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE REQUEST,<br>YOU COME TO OUR WEDDING AS OUR GUEST,<br>
			    TO SHARE WITH US OUR SPECIAL DAY,<br>AND HAVE SOME FUN ALONG THE WAY.</p>
